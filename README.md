PyAR is a perpetually incomplete, general-purpose toolbox for common post-processing 
tasks involving synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Users can find interferometric SAR 
(InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) tools along with tools for 1D data sets, such 
as GPS and seismic data. Contents include command-line Python scripts and Python, 
C/C++, and Fortran functions.
