PySAR documentation
===================

PyAR is a perpetually incomplete, shoddily written, general-purpose toolbox for common post-processing tasks involving synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Users can find interferometric SAR (InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) tools along with tools for 1D data sets, such as GPS and seismic data. Contents include command-line Python scripts and Python, C/C++, and Fortran functions.
